# pokeProject

A Poke Web was created where you can view Pokémon with pagination. Additionally, you can add them to favorites and filter by them. You can also search by name.
Each Pokémon, when selected, displays a summary with its main characteristics.

To run the project:
```bash
  npm run dev
```
